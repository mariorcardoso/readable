# Readable Project

This project started with the template provided by Udacity in which I added the features requested.

## Install and Start

The application was developed on top of the starter template as such it only requires two steps to get it installed and launched:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
