# Readable API Server and Frontend Web App

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where I built a content and comment web app. Users are able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server provided by Udacity and the frontend web app built by myself to the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course.

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).

## Frontend Web App

Information about the Frontend web app and how to use it can be found in its [README file](frontend/README.md).
